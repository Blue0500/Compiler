Subtype - A is a subtype of B if A can be converted to B with no memory allocations
Dependent Type - A is a dependent type of B if A can be interpreted as B with no conversion

Flow typing/dependent type rules

int			=> singular int
function	=> singular function
union		=> union component
array		=> fixed array

Expressions can be types with a dependent type, meaning they are guaranteed to follow the restraints

Variables can also be incidentally dependent, meaning in a particular context the type can be constrained
