let x = mut int[];

let y = int^;


Region rules for assignment:
NOPE - 1. The assigned expression *must* outlive the current expression

2. The assigned expression must outlive where the variable is allocated



var test = A
test = B

// Mutation of test through alias
*(&test) = 90;

// Possible mutation of test through alias
some_func(&test);


test.some = new ...

3 permissions: mutable, immutable, readonly
mut int[]
ref int[]

Roots are created when a lifetime exists that cannot be referenced
in terms of previous lifetimes. Right now the only three root-creation
events are function parameters, the built-in heap, and dereferencing
a pointer

The problem:
Lifetimes are created at discreet program points and the variables they are based
on change at discreet program points, so lifetime code has to be contextual
just like other declarations

Idea:
int* should refer to unmanaged pointers while int^ to references, or managed pointers
The difference between them would be bitwidth, and the fact that references work with
regions while unmanaged pointers don't


Why have a single lifetime per path, with multiple paths per variable?
Why not just a single path per variable, each storing a lifetime bundle?
