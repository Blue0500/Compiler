let x = mut int[];

let y = int^;


3 access: mutable, immutable, readonly
mut int[]
ref int[]

Roots are created when a lifetime exists that cannot be referenced
in terms of previous lifetimes. Right now the only two root-creation
events are function parameters, the built-in heap, and dereferencing
a pointer




Idea:
int* should refer to unmanaged pointers while int^ to references, or managed pointers
The difference between them would be bitwidth, and the fact that references work with
regions while unmanaged pointers don't
